        The redux pattern is very handy for updating and tracking
        changes to a data store that multiple resources rely on for
        up-to-date information simultaneously. How does this pattern
        keep all components dependent on a single source synchronized to
        one data source?

            It uses selectors to get the latest information that is stored
            in the store/state.
          </li>
          <li>
            This information is gathered in the component and displayed in
            the view.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the user interacts with view and changes the state of the
            application this information and new state will be packaged
            into actions in the Component and sent to the reducers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reducers are listening for specific actions that carry
            payloads of new information about the changes to the state
          </li>
          <li>
            The reducers copy the existing data and augment it with the
            payload from the actions carrying the new changes to state
            using a spread operator, creating the new state.
          </li>
          <li>The new state is saved to the store</li>
          <li>
            The selectors that have been listening for changes to the
            state, notify all the components subscribed simultaneously of
            the new state.
          </li>
        </ul>

        The process happens over and over again. The store cannot be
        changed directly and all changes to the store must follow this
        strict process in order to protect the integrity of the data.
