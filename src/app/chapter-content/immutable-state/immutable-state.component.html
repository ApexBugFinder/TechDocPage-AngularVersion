        Every angular application must manage itsâ€™ state. As your
        application grows so does the size of the state that the
        application has to manage. Larger state means more application
        to manage more information, more state to manage, more actions
        and reactions to state changes to track and test. Very powerful
        when all the pieces of application state is held in one place
        the store because it will help with reasoning about user
        interaction, debugging, performance and avoiding race
        conditions.

        The store is what we call an immutable store. Immutability is
        paramount to the integrity of the store. Immutability insures
        the data is accurate across all components by insuring there is
        only one path to changing the store. For the redux pattern to
        work you must follow the redux principals of immutability:

          If you need to change state of the store always replace the
          whole state object and not mutate part of it
        </li>
        <li class="chapterContent-li">
          Only use actions to change the state of the store
        </li>
        <li class="chapterContent-li">
          Data that never changes is easier to reason about, track, and
          test.

        What kind of information can I store in my State/Immutable
        Store?
